# Infinitely Repeating Structures (Seed Finder)
This is a small and miniature repository primarily used to search for seeds involving vertically, horizontally, and diagonally infinitely repeating structures for both Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition 1.18+. This [website](https://yourlocalknight.github.io/Infinity-Finder/) simply formulates sister seeds of a given base seed of your choice and copies the exact same structure placements and attributes. This means that while the biomes and terrain will differ depending on the seed, other features will stay the same according to the repeating pattern you select.
# Features
- Generate up to 10,000 infinitely repeating seeds for either Java or Bedrock
- Copy all seeds to clipboard
- Download all seeds in a file
- Theme and color palette customization
